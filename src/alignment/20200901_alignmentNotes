## Using BWA
This is used for aligning reads to a reference genome

## Data availability section from second cod genome assembly (TÃ¸rresen et al. 2017)

The major hurtle is getting my merged reads to be combined with my unmerged reads. Jon has code in dDocent for this but I have struggled to understand how it works.

UPDATE: Based on conversation with Jon, we do not need to merge reads when using whole-genome data. We actually lose a significant amount of data from doing this. 

Notes from 20201006 Meeting with Jon
	Less than 6 hours per sample 
	New version of BWA - BWA-mem2
	Total size of your reads x 4 

## Arguments

	-t number of threads .. we can parallalize this process should we do this? 

	-L ? clipping penalty not really sure how this works

	-a output all found alignments for SE or unpaired paired end; flagged as secondary alignments

	-A matching score

	-B mismatch penalty

	-O gap penalty
